This is, at the moment, just an automatically translated version of David Howden's MAGMA TextMate Bundle.

It provides syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and snippets for the MAGMA Computational Algebra package.

At some point I am hoping to update with some features from the Bettale/Thibault Emacs package.
