This started life as an automatically translated version of David Howden's MAGMA TextMate Bundle, I have done some tweaks and modifications along the way.

It provides syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and snippets for the MAGMA Computational Algebra package.

I have been hoping to update with a tree-sitter version at some point.
